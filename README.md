# Simple Sonoff

![](images/sonoff.png "Sonoff Range")

Simple Sonoff is alternative firmware for Sonoff ESP-8266-based switches and relays that allows you to control them via MQTT. It is based on the [KmanSonoff firmware](https://github.com/KmanOz/KmanSonoff) which works great but has been unmaintained for a couple of years. The goal of this project is to cleanup the existing code base and add a few new features while sticking as close to the original functionality as possible.

This is a work in progress and has not yet been fully tested. Use at your own risk.
